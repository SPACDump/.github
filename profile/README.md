# helo pls go away
there's literally nothing here,

for context AI gave me the name and this is an org where I throw all of my old repos that I refuse to delete to keep my main github @jsJack tidy

AI came up with the name

Stored Projects and Code
or
Stale Projects and Code

both of which are probably true, most of this old unmaintainable code stinks
